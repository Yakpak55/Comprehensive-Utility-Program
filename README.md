# Comprehensive-Utility-Program
Developed a C program that encompasses a series of utility functions to handle various computational tasks. The program includes functionalities such as calculating change from a transaction, generating a restaurant receipt, analyzing grade distributions, and updating values through pointer manipulation. The project is designed to provide hands-on experience with user-defined functions, dynamic memory handling, file I/O operations, and fundamental C programming concepts.

Code Functionality:

● Change Calculation: Computes the amount of change to be returned to a customer based on the amount paid and the amount due, breaking it down into denominations of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

● Restaurant Receipt Generation: Takes user input to create a restaurant order, calculates the total cost, and generates a detailed receipt saved in a text file.

● Grade Distribution Analysis: Reads grades from a text file and calculates the distribution of grades (A, B, C, D, F), displaying the results.

● Value Increment Update: Uses pointers to increment a value based on user input, demonstrating the use of pointers and dynamic value updates.
